# CTE Core Default Configuration
#
# This file contains the default configuration values for the Content Transfer Engine (CTE) Core ChiMod.
# These defaults are used when no explicit configuration is provided.
#
# For complete documentation of all parameters, see: docs/cte/config.md

# Performance tuning parameters
performance:
  # Interval in milliseconds for updating target performance statistics
  target_stat_interval_ms: 5000

  # Size of blob operation cache in megabytes (16GB default)
  blob_cache_size_mb: 16384

  # Maximum number of concurrent I/O operations
  max_concurrent_operations: 64

  # Threshold for triggering blob reorganization based on score (0.0-1.0)
  score_threshold: 0.7

  # Minimum score difference required to trigger reorganization (0.0-1.0)
  score_difference_threshold: 0.05

# Target management settings
targets:
  # Number of storage targets (nodes) CTE can buffer data to
  neighborhood: 4

  # Default timeout for target I/O operations in milliseconds
  default_target_timeout_ms: 30000

  # Period for rescanning targets to update statistics in milliseconds
  poll_period_ms: 5000

# Storage device configuration
# Note: At least one storage device must be configured for CTE to function
# The example below shows a minimal configuration that must be customized
storage:
  devices:
    - path: "/tmp/cte_storage"
      bdev_type: "file"
      capacity: "10GB"
      score: -1.0  # -1.0 = automatic scoring based on performance

# Data Placement Engine (DPE) configuration
dpe:
  # Algorithm used for data placement
  # Options: "random", "round_robin", "max_bw", "score_based"
  dpe_type: "max_bw"
