# WRP Content Adapter Engine (CAE) Configuration
# 
# This configuration file defines which paths should be tracked by the
# CTE adapters and adapter-specific settings.

# Paths to track for adapter interception
# These can be:
# - Absolute paths (e.g., /tmp, /scratch)
# - Directory prefixes (e.g., /data/datasets)
# - Any string that will be matched as a prefix
paths:
  - "/tmp"           # Temporary directory
  - "/scratch"       # Scratch space
  - "/data"          # Data directory
  - "/mnt/shared"    # Shared mount point

# Adapter page size in bytes
# This controls the granularity of I/O operations in the adapters
# Common values: 4096, 8192, 16384, 65536
adapter_page_size: 4096
